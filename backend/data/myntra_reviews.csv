"5/5 Stars - A Game-Changing Audio Experience!*

""I'm absolutely blown away by these wireless earbuds! The sound quality is crystal clear, with deep bass and crisp treble that makes every song feel like a live performance. The comfort level is exceptional - I can wear them for hours without feeling any discomfort or fatigue.

The battery life is impressive, easily lasting a full day with moderate use. The charging case is sleek and compact, making it perfect for tossing into a pocket or bag.

But what really sets these earbuds apart is their seamless connectivity and intuitive controls. Pairing is effortless, and the touch controls are responsive and easy to use.

Whether I'm working out, commuting, or just relaxing, these earbuds have become my go-to companion. They're a must-have for anyone seeking a premium wireless audio experience. Don't hesitate - grab a pair and discover a whole new world of sound!""",5
"Good balanced over all sound.
Base also good.
Sound quality is best compared to 1+ and realme.
Sound seperation is good.. 
We tuned sound.
High's also good but not that much great.

Over all very good for the price..

It's not high-end product. According to budget all acceptable.

Comfort is also good. Same as 1+.
Bass mode some what increases the bass.
Bass is not boasted balanced. 

#For budget music lovers üíï..",5
"Superb deal ... I got this at 1k rup,ees effectively , after applying 4 -00 cupan co de for 1st order for new myntra user & 1 00 cas bak on A irtel pa yme nt b- anks .
At this price no one can beat this oppo enco air 2i or buds 2 in  sound department, 
Crystal clear instruction & quality bass ...
You will enjoy.
I have not tested microphone cause i got this 1 hour ago only. I'll update later.
I have used oppo enco m31 neckband,oppo enco m32 , OnePlus bullet z2 &  ANC both  edition +  realme buds wireless 3 neckband ...
I can say this beats all of the above 
Even this can tough compition to Realme buds wireless 3 in sound quality, but vocals of oppo will beat them .",5
"These earbuds are amazing!! one of the best in this price range. It has a balanced audio not to much bass which is what I prefer. 
I was actually confused between these nd realme t110 but decided to go with oppo enco air 2i nd don't regret my decision.
One drawback I would like to say is that it's case is too shiny and slippery so might have to get a case cover for that",5
"I bought it in ‚Çπ1304 it comes with a good circular designed case, sound quality is awesome with crystal clear sound and good base, loved the earbuds at this price",5
"Good quality product, I satisfied from product.... thanks Myntra...keep it up...",5
